# At a Glance

`DataKit` is an extremely fast in-memory database with intuitive and powerful internal language. It's developed with keeping in mind main troubles that iOS developer encounter with traditional databases like CoreData. To simplify development process, `DataKit` is based on several axioms:

1. **No contexts.** Really. Who need those different contexts for each thread in CoreData? Everybody tired of them. This is a useless waste of time to write a code for retrieveing the same object from another context in another thread. `DataKit` uses one context and it's hidden from developer.
2. **Never freeze UI queue.** `DataKit` uses its own queue for all operations. They are performed asynchronously and never stop UI updates.
3. **Be relational.** You can work with classes like with tables in SQL database. No more to say here.
4. **Self-learning.** Yes, `DataKit` has a self-learning algorithm. More requests to database you make, faster you get results.

# How To Get Started
